     <p>According to consensus in modern genetics, 
        anatomically modern humans first arrived on the Indian subcontinent
         from Africa between 73,000 and 55,000 years ago.[1] However, 
         the earliest known human remains in South Asia date to 30,000 years 
         ago. Settled life, which involves the transition from foraging to farming and 
         pastoralism,began in South Asia around 7000 BCE</p>
